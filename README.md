# Sort Visualizer
This is a webpage to visualize sorting algorithms. You can also shuffle and try
different permutations. I have hosted it on this link https://ranveer112.github.io/Sort-Visualizer/. For the time being, I have added MergeSort, selectionSort, bubbleSort. QuickSort will be added soon.
